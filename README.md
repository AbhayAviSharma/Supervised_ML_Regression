# Supervised_ML_Regression
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust Machine Learning Regression model that can accurately forecast YES Bank's monthly closing Stock prices using past data . We have used "Python" libraries like "Pandas", "NumPy" for EDA, libraries like "Matplotlib", "Seaborn" for visualization and "Sci-kit learn" library for modelÂ building.
